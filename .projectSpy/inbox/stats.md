Stats
===

I really want a stats page that shows some statistics of tasks.

Maybe these could be line charts with x being day and y being number of tickets in done last modified on that day:
Tickets completed per day of week
Tickets completed over the last 7 days

These might be tough, what does created mean? is it affected when a task moves directories?
Tickets created over the last 7 days
Tickets created per day of week

A pie chart for ticket directory distribution would need to figure out a fitting minimal style
