View Transitions
---

Wouldn't it be awesome to have view transitions for opening/closing the modals?

I think this made need some prototyping and practice before.

From what I have seen and prototyped, dialogs aren't transitioned with view transition. We could make the dialogs divs and make it a progressive enhancement, but I don't believe the effort is worth it.
